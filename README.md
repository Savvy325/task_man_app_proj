# **Mini Project: Task Management Application Project**

*Welcome to our Candle website where we create a user friendly environment and incorporate task management for our employees!*

## **Building our Prototype**
```
First thing we did was build a basic wireframe using Figma to get an understanding of what we would like our website to look like.
You can view that here: https://www.figma.com/file/st6twvMDK0N93HFuUPU3CO/Untitled?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=pqjQcOObVcCenHSG-1
```
## **Task Management Features**
```
✅ A Home Page introducing our product with and easy to use navigation bar.
      ✅ A carousel component displaying our candles.
      ✅ And Cards giving a few details on each product. 
    
✅ A Task Dashboard that lists what orders are complete and need to be completed.
      ✅This is displayed using an accordion component.
